# Learning Journal — Agentic AI

*A place for observations, questions, and synthesis. Not answers — thinking.*

---

## How to use this journal

After each significant exercise or insight, write briefly:
- **What happened** (what you did, what you observed)
- **What surprised you** (the unexpected is where learning lives)
- **What questions emerged** (the sign of real understanding)

No structure required. Stream of consciousness is fine. Bullet points are fine. A single sentence is fine. The act of writing is the act of thinking.
