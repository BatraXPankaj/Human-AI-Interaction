# Agentic AI Learning Plan — Copilot Ecosystem

**Duration**: 6 weeks | ~1-2 hours/day  
**Stack**: GitHub Copilot (Chat, Agent Mode, Extensions, MCP), VS Code, Copilot Workspace  
**Philosophy**: Learn by building within the tools you already use. No framework tourism.

---

## The Three Tracks (Run in Parallel)

| Track | Focus | You become... |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **BUILD** | Hands-on projects using Copilot agent mode, custom agents, MCP servers | A builder of agents |
| **UNDERSTAND** | Architecture, patterns, protocols, limitations | An architect of agent systems |
| **QUESTION** | Philosophy of agency, intelligence, creativity, ethics | A thinker about agency itself |

## Weekly Structure

| Week | Theme | Build Track | Understand Track | Question Track |
|------|-------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | The Agent Loop | Your first custom agent.md | Anatomy of an agent | What is agency? |
| 2 | Tools & Perception | MCP server from scratch | Tool-use & function calling | The hand and the hammer |
| 3 | Planning & Reasoning | Multi-step task agent | ReAct, Plan-and-Execute patterns | Can machines reason? |
| 4 | Multi-Agent Systems | Agent orchestration project | Delegation, coordination, conflict | Collective intelligence |
| 5 | Evaluation & Trust | Agent with guardrails | Evals, failure modes, bias | Trust and the control problem |
| 6 | Synthesis & Mastery | Your capstone agent | Architecture review | Your philosophy of agency |

## Verification Milestones

- [ ] **Week 2**: You can build a custom Copilot agent + MCP server for any domain
- [ ] **Week 4**: You can explain agent patterns to a non-technical executive using zero jargon
- [ ] **Week 6**: You can articulate what agents *cannot* do as clearly as what they can
- [ ] **Week 6**: You've built something that solves a real problem you have
