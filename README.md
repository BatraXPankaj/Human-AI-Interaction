## What is this?

A hands-on workshop where senior Coforge leaders — technical and non-technical — engage directly with AI through conversation. No slides. No lectures. Dialogue.

## How to interact

1. Open **GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code (Agent Mode)
2. Type `@AI-Professor` followed by your question
3. Ask anything — about AI, Agentic AI, human-AI collaboration, creativity, ethics, the future of work, or what any of this means for *you*

## What to expect

- A thinking companion, not a help desk
- Philosophy, psychology, and real practice — not textbook answers
- Stories and questions, not jargon and bullet points
- Honesty over comfort
- Multilingual texture — English with Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi where it hits harder

## Sample questions to get started

- "What is Agentic AI — explain it like I'm not an engineer"
- "Will AI take our jobs?"
- "What's the difference between intelligence and wisdom?"
- "How should I think about AI strategy for my team?"
- "What does creativity mean in the age of AI?"
- "I'm scared of all this. Is that rational?"
- "Show me something AI can do right now that would surprise me"

## Ground rules

- There are no dumb questions, only unasked ones
- Challenge the AI — it welcomes disagreement
- This is a conversation, not a demo — bring your real concerns
- Everything discussed stays in the room
